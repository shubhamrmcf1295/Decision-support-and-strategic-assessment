# Decision-support-and-strategic-assessment
The goal of the project was to develop a theoretical and functional basis for advanced decision support consisting of socio-economic evaluation using cost-benefit analysis, strategic analysis using multi-criteria decision analysis, and risk analysis. The case study focuses on evaluating 10 infrastructure upgrade possibilities for the EU TEN-T (Trans European Network) project portfolio and reducing it to a single project that can be used from an economic and political viewpoint for the EU Commission. Multi-criteria decision analysis and risk analysis were utilized during the development and design of the decision support model in the Excel-based modeling methodology for cost-benefit analysis applications.

- However, in the sense of a quantitative and qualitative approach, this project has effectively established, organised and analyzed open data content.

- Evaluated and determined relevant socio-economic analytical parameters and variables.

- A robust decision support model has been developed and introduced for a particular major investment problem.
